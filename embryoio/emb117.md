FIFOs are funny things. If a process tries to open one for reading, it will block until there's a process that opens it for writing. Conversely, if a process tries to open one for writingt, it will block until there's a process that opens it for reading. However, multiple processes can open it for reading or writing

So

![I took a fifo file(named pipe), and for the challenge to output fifo, I used dup2(fileDescriptor, STDOUTFILENO) while fifo file needs both end, I use other process with dup2(fd, STDINFILENO)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (124).png>)

![So I get the flag.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)
