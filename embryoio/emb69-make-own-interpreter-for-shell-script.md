# ðŸŸ¢ emb69: Make own interpreter for shell script \#

This challenge was very tricky one.

Since it requests you to run bash script, but without any argument. Thus argc==0. However shell script itself is taken as an arg\[0]. So normally there's no way argc == 0. However

As it is true that by patchelf you can change interpreter and here, if you name a bin as bash then it can be executed.&#x20;

So I get the flag.
